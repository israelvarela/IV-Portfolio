          <p>
            I am Full Stack Web Developer with an eye for business applications
            and functional use cases to drive usage of the applications I
            develop. Having worked on several Wordpress websites over the years
            for personal use, as well as for clients I decided it was time to
            step up my knowledge of coding for wider applications and
            development. I enrolled in Southern Methodist University's Full
            Stack Web Development program where I would go on to learn many of
            the in demand programming languages and frameworks utilized in
            today's competitive technology workforce. Having graduated with a
            certificate in Full Stack Web Development I am looking for a
            challenging opportunity with a forward thinking company so we can
            build some great things together.{" "}

            As a seasoned professional I have tackled many roles in my life from
            marketing and data analytics, to residential real estate sales, as
            well as acting in commericals, industrials, short films, feature
            films and nationally syndicated television shows. When I am not
            working I enjoy running, working out, camping, hiking, fishing,
            spending time with my family and volunteering to give back to the
            community.
